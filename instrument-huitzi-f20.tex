\chapter{The Huitzi $f/20$ Imager}

The Huitzi $f/20$ imager was installed on the COATLI telescope in December 2022. The imager is named for the mexica god \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huītzilōpōchtli}{Huītzilōpōchtli}, the son of the goddess Coatlicue.

Earlier, the “Interim Imager” and “Huitzi $f/8$ Imager” were installed on the telescope. For historical reference, these are described in Appendices~\ref{appendix:interim-imager} and \ref{appendix:instrument-huitzi-f8}.

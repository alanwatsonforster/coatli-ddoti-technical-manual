\chapter{Operations}
\label{chapter:operations}

{\projectname} is in regular robotic operation under the responsibility of the observatory staff. Weather permitting, {\projectname} will operate from 30 minutes before sunset to the end of morning astronomical twilight.

\section{Participants}

By “observatory staff” we refer to the telescope operators, resident astronomers, and maintenance technicians. The actually division of responsibilities will be decided by the Secretario Técnico of the observatory.

By “team members” we refer to members of the {\projectname} technical teams.

\section{Communications}

Communication between the observatory staff and the team will take place primarily through the COATLI/DDOTI Workspace in Google Chat.

\section{Daily Operations}

The daily operating procedure is:

\begin{enumerate}

\item At the latest one hour before sunset, the observatory staff will carry out a review of the {\projectname} installation. 

This revision has three elements. The observatory staff will:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Check that all of the control system servers are not showing errors in the web interface (see \S\ref{figure:interface-main-page}). If there are problems, attempt to solve them by pressing the “Restart” button in the web interface and giving the system a couple of minutes to restart. If that doesn't work, seek the help of a team member.
\item
Check that the webcams in the web interface are not showing an unusual situation.
\item
If necessary, carry out an on-site inspection of {\projectname}. For example, after a snowfall, it might not be obvious from the webcams whether snow remains on the roof of the enclosure.
\end{enumerate}

If the observatory staff consider that decisions to open and close the installation can be safely taken by the control system, they will enable the supervisor by pressing the “Enable” button in web interface (see \S\ref{figure:interface-main-page}). 

If the observatory staff considers that decisions to open and close the installation cannot be safely taken by the control system, they should explicitly force the supervisor to maintain the telescope closed by pressing the “Close” button in  the web interface (see \S\ref{figure:interface-main-page}).. 

The observatory staff will report the result of their inspection in the Google chat and will indicate whether they are enabling the supervisor or forcing it to close.

\item
If the supervisor is enabled and weather conditions are benign, the control system will:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Open partially to cool about half an hour before sunset;
\item
Open completely to observe at sunset; and
\item
Close at the end of morning astronomical twilight.
\end{enumerate}

If the supervisor is enabled and weather conditions are not benign, the control system will not open (if closed) or will close (if open).

If the supervisor is enabled and weather conditions change from not benign to benign, the control system will open partially to cool (between half and hour before sunset and sunset) or open completely to observe (between sunset and the end of morning astronomical twilight).

\item
The supervisor considers weather conditions to be \emph{not benign} if:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is raining or snowing.
\item The humidity is 85\% or higher and rising or previously reached 90\% and has not yet fallen below 80\%.
\item The wind average speed has been 30 km/h or greater at any moment in the previous 30 minutes.  
\end{enumerate}
Note that the rules for opening the other telescopes specify a wind limit of 45 km/h. The limit for {\projectname} is currently lower until we have greater confidence in its reliability and performance in high winds.

\item
The observatory staff will monitor {\projectname} during the night. Their primary responsibilities are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the observatory staff consider that decisions to open and close the installation can be safely taken by the control system, they should enable the supervisor by pressing the “Enable” button in the web interface (see \S\ref{figure:interface-main-page}) and report this in the Google chat.
\item If the observatory staff consider that decisions to open and close the installation cannot be safely taken by the control system, they must explicitly force the supervisor to maintain the telescope closed by pressing the “Close” button in the web interface (see \S\ref{figure:interface-main-page}) and report this in the Google chat. 
\item
The observatory staff should verify that the control system opens and closes as expected according to the weather conditions and the state of the supervisor. If it does not close, they should intervene as described in \S\ref{section:operations:interventions}.

\item
When the control system closes (at the end of the night, in response to weather conditions, or if the supervisor is forced to close), it switches the lights on for safety. At the end of the process, if the control system can determine that the enclosure closed correctly, it will switch the lights off. If it cannot, it will leave the lights switched on. Thus, if the lights are left on, this indicates that there was a problem during closing and the observatory staff should intervene as described in \S\ref{section:operations:interventions}.

\item
The observatory staff should report explicit changes to the supervisor state (e.g., use of the “Enable” and “Close” buttons) and any other relevant information in the Google chat.
\end{enumerate}

As their other duties permit, the observatory staff are encouraged to report other conditions or occurrences that might degrade the ability of the telescope to observe (e.g., failures of the control system or failures to focus) in the Google chat.

\item
During the evening and night, interventions by the observatory staff are limited to whatever is necessary to close {\projectname} and return it to a safe state. Once the observatory staff have intervened, {\projectname} must be closed and may not open again until the next day.

\item
Requests by team members for interventions beyond those needed to close {\projectname} correctly will be directed to the Secretario Técnico of the observatory.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Interventions to Close}
\label{section:operations:interventions}

The control system should normally operate without problems and with minimal action on the part of the observatory staff beyond setting the supervisor mode. However, in the event of a failure, the observatory staff may need to intervene to close.

If the control system does not close when expected or does not close correctly, the observatory staff should:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
First attempt to close normally:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Press the “Close” button in web interface (see \S\ref{figure:interface-main-page}). This should turn on the enclosure lights and close.
\item
Check the web interface and webcams for success or failure.
\end{enumerate}
\item
If that fails, attempt an emergency close:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Press the “Emergency Close” button in the web interface (see \S\ref{interface-close-button}). This should turn on the enclosure lights and close.
\item
Check the web interface and webcams for success or failure.
\end{enumerate}
\item
If that fails, close the enclosure locally according to the procedure in \S\ref{section:enclosure-opening-or-closing-in-local-mode}.
\item
If that fails, close the enclosure manually according to the procedures in 
\S\ref{section:enclosure-manual-opening-or-closing-without-power}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Weekly Inspection}

The observatory staff should carry out a physical inspection of the installations during daytime at least once per week (if weather conditions permit). The Secretario Técnico will determine the schedule for this inspection.

\subsubsection{Safety Considerations}

\safety{You must use a safety harness, line, and helmet whenever you are on the  platform or balconies or to ascend the tower. Attach your line to one of the fasteners, to the balcony rail, or to something equivalently strong.}

\safety{You must use a safety helmet if you are working under the platform or balconies.}

\safety{See \S\ref{section:personnel-safety} for a more complete discussion of safety.}

\subsubsection{Requirements}

You will need:
\begin{itemize}
\item At least two persons.
\item The key to the shed (see \S\ref{section:shed}).
\item Weather conditions adequate for opening the enclosure and ascending to the platform.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Verify that there is a fire extinguisher in the shed.
\item 
Verify that the web interface open on the Raspberry Pi in the shed. If it is not, open it by following the procedures in \S\ref{section:interface-local-access}.
\item 
Inspect the inside of the shed. 
\item 
Inspect the columns and underside of the platform.
\item
Open the enclosure locally to 60 degrees using the procedure in \S\ref{section:enclosure-opening-or-closing-in-local-mode}.
\item
One person should ascend to the platform to inspect: the electronics boxes, the instrument, the telescope, the mount, and the platform.
\item
Close the enclosure locally using the procedure in \S\ref{section:enclosure-opening-or-closing-in-local-mode}, but leave the enclosure controller in local mode.
\item
The person on the platform should inspect the enclosure roof from the inside.
\item
Open the enclosure locally using the procedure in \S\ref{section:enclosure-opening-or-closing-in-local-mode}.
\item
The person on the platform should descend.
\item
Leave the enclosure controller in remote mode.
\item
Report that the revision has been carried out and any anomalies in COATLI/DDOTI Workspace in Google Chat.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Soft Shut-Down and Start-Up}

A “soft” shut-down is appropriate for circumstances in which electrical power will continue to be supplied to {\projectname}. This is the normal situation over the winter break. In this case, we can leave the computers on and rely on the electromagnet to maintain the enclosure closed.

\subsection{Soft Shut-Down}

\section{Maintenance Procedures}

\subsection{Changing a Detector}

The detectors are attached to an adapter which is in turn attached to a mounting ring on the telescope corrector plate. The mounting ring is held against rotation only by friction. Thus, care must be taken to avoid placing a torque on the mounting ring when manipulating the detector and adapter.

\subsubsection{Safety Considerations}
\label{section:changing-a-detector}

\safety{Use a harness, line, and helmet when you work on the platform or balconies.}

\safety{Under no circumstances ascend to the platform or balconies if the enclosure is in remote mode as the enclosure can close without warning.}

\subsubsection{Requirements}

You will need:

\begin{itemize}
\item Two persons.
\item The key to the shed (see \S\ref{section:shed-key}).
\item Metric hex keys (specifically, 2 and 2.5 mm)
\item Wire cutters
\item Cable ties
\item A spirit level
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Use appropriate safety equipment: harnesses, lines, and helmets. These are found in the shed.

\item
Move the enclosure controller mode selector switch to “LOCAL”.

\item If the weather permits, open the enclosure to 60 $\deg$.

Set the angle selector switch to the 60 $\deg$ and then press and hold the “OPEN” button until the green light goes out.

\item Ascend to the platform.

\label{figure:instrument-ddoti-slackening-grub-screw}
\end{figure*}

\item Using a 2 mm hex key, gently slacken the grub screw that stops the detector from rotating in its adapter. Support the detector to avoid placing a torque on the mounting ring. See Figure~\ref{figure:instrument-ddoti-slackening-grub-screw}.

\caption{Removing the detector. One person should support the adapter against rotation while the other person unscrews the detector.}
\label{figure:instrument-ddoti-removing-detector}
\end{figure*}

\item While one person holds the tip tilt adapter to prevent it from placing a torque on the mounting ring, the other should gently unscrew the detector. See Figure~\ref{figure:instrument-ddoti-removing-detector}.

\caption{Attaching the new detector to the adapter.}
\label{figure:instrument-ddoti-attaching-detector}
\end{figure*}

\item Screw the new detector into the adapter and tighten the grub screw. See Figure~\ref{figure:instrument-ddoti-attaching-detector}.

\caption{Attaching a cable tie to the detector prior to mounting it on the telescope.}
\label{figure:instrument-ddoti-attaching-cable-tie}
\end{figure*}

\item Thread a small cable tie through the appropriate base. 

It is important to do this before you attach the adapter to the mounting ring, to avoid placing a torque on the mounting ring. See Figure~\ref{figure:instrument-ddoti-attaching-cable-tie}.

\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}

\end{center}
\caption{Attaching the adapter to the mounting ring. Be careful to avoid placing a torque on the mounting ring.}
\label{figure:instrument-ddoti-attaching-adapter}
\end{figure*}

\item Attach the adapter to the mounting ring. 

All of the detectors have the same orientation, so you can use the others as guides. You can select the appropriate set of holes in the mounting ring to give approximate alignment and then gently rotate the adapter in its slots for fine alignment. Use a level to guide you.
Make sure the hex screws are adequately lose before turning the adapter, to avoid placing a torque on the mounting ring. See Figure~\ref{figure:instrument-ddoti-attaching-adapter}.

\item Attach the cables to the detector and secure them with the cable tie. Support the detector to prevent it from placing a torque on the mounting ring.

\item Descend from the platform.

\item Close the enclosure. If the red error button is lit or flashing, press it to clear the error. (Often you will activate the safety strip when entering or leaving the enclosure.) Press and hold the “CLOSE” button until the green light goes off.

\item 
Move the enclosure controller mode selector switch to “REMOTE”.

\item
Replace all tools and equipment in their correct places.

\item Communicate with the DDOTI team who will configure the new detector in the control system, restart the software, and verify that the detector is integrated correctly.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Changing a Shutter}

\safety{Use a harness, line, and helmet when you work on the platform or balconies.}

\safety{Under no circumstances ascend to the platform or balconies if the enclosure is in remote mode as the enclosure can close without warning.}

\safety{Do not touch the shutter blades.}

\safety{Always wear nitrile gloves when handling a shutter.}

\subsubsection{Requirements}

You will need:

\begin{itemize}
\item Two persons.
\item A protective cover for the detector.
\item Nitrile gloves
\item A 1/16-inch hex key
\item PH00 screwdriver
\item Needle-nosed pliers
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Use appropriate safety equipment: harnesses, lines, and helmets. These are found in the shed.

\item You will first need to remove the detector from the telescope. See \S\ref{section:changing-a-detector}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/instrument-ddoti-detector-cover}
\end{center}
\caption{A protective cover installed on a detector.}
\label{figure:instrument-ddoti-detector-cover}
\end{figure}

\item Install the protective cover over the detector. See Figure \ref{figure:instrument-ddoti-detector-cover}.

\item Carefully take the detector to a clean place (e.g., the 84-cm building or the optics lab at the 2.1-meter building). Use a backpack or place the detector in the red zippered bag, close it, and lower it from the platform using a rope.

\item 
Use nitrile gloves.

\end{figure}

\item Gently lift the shutter. Do not touch the shutter blades. Use needle-nosed pliers to remove the connector. See Figure \ref{figure:instrument-ddoti-detector-shutter-connector}.

\item Lift the old shutter and put it to one side.

\end{enumerate}

\item Install the new shutter.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use needle-nosed pliers to insert the connector. See Figure \ref{figure:instrument-ddoti-detector-shutter-connector}. The connector is keyed to ensure the correct polarity.

\item Using the PH00 screwdriver, insert the three screws that hold the shutter to the detector body. See Figure \ref{figure:instrument-ddoti-detector-shutter-screws}.

\item Replace the face plate. Using the 1/16-inch hex key, insert the three screws that hold the face plate to the detector body. See Figure \ref{figure:instrument-ddoti-detector-face-plate-screws}.

\end{enumerate}

\item Carefully return the detector to the platform. Use a backpack or place the detector in the red zippered bag, close it, and raise it to the platform using a rope.

\item Reinstall the detector. See \S\ref{section:changing-a-detector}.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Calibration Data}

\subsection{Biases and Darks}

\subsection{Flats}

\subsection{Gain and Read Noise}

The control system does not automatically take data for calibrating the gain and read-noise, but there are blocks that can be executed manually either in evening or morning twilight. 

For best results, do this procedure either at the start of evening civil twilight or the start of morning nautical twilight.

The procedure is:

\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure the telescope is closed:
\begin{verbatim}
tcs request supervisor close
\end{verbatim}
\item Unpark the telescope and cool the instrument:
\begin{verbatim}
tcs request telescope unpark
tcs request instrument open
\end{verbatim}
\item Wait for the detector to cool to the operating temperature. Then run the morning or evening block, as appropriate:
\begin{verbatim}
tcs request executor execute block \
  /usr/local/var/tcs/blocks/0013-signal-chain-morning.json
tcs request executor execute block \
  /usr/local/var/tcs/blocks/0013-signal-chain-evening.json
\end{verbatim}
The difference between the blocks is that in the morning the block takes biases and then flats, whereas in the evening it takes flats and then biases.
\item
One the block has finished, close the telescope again by running:
\begin{verbatim}
tcs request executor close
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

For these data:
\begin{itemize}
\item The program identifier is 0013. 
\item The block identifier is 0 for the morning and 1 for the evening. 
\item The data are taken in visit 0.
\end{itemize}

The block takes 10 biases and attempts to obtain 10 flats with levels suitable for determining the gain. These flats will normally be the last 10 flats, as the block waits for the signal in the flat to be in a suitable range.

The dome lights should not be switched on during this process. If they are, then the biases might be contaminated with light and the flats will be saturated. Note that sometimes the technical staff switch the lights on in the morning to check that the enclosures have closed, so you should warn them in the chat that you are taking calibration data and that they should not do this.
